# vk_gltf_viewer

Originally meant as an example application for [fastgltf](https://github.com/spnda/fastgltf), this has evolved into an advanced Vulkan glTF renderer.
It still shares a lot of the codebase with the OpenGL example for fastgltf, but tries to connect advanced rendering using Vulkan with fastgltf.
